        <div>
          <ol>
            <li><p><dfn>1/24/2021:</dfn> Created the barebones Hypixel SkyBlock Goal Schema website with... Nothing.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>1/24/2021:</dfn> Used some of my own CSS code.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>1/24/2021:</dfn> Added prompt on home screen and edited it.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>1/24/2021:</dfn> Added incomplete Pumpkin Minion goal schema and added a Reset button, which all work with script and more CSS.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>1/31/2021:</dfn> Added Pumpkin Farm mixed into the Pumpkin Minion goal schema and tweaked other crucial enhancements related to usage and links turning purple.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>2/27/2021:</dfn> [v0.0.1] Added a version counter at the bottom.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>2/27/2021:</dfn> [v0.0.2] Added a pretty-detailed Getting Started goal schema, with getting to Jerry (which initially had a typo of "arond" instead of "around") and talking to the villagers that can be accessed with even more script.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>2/27/2021:</dfn> Made the actual thread and put its link on there and added a link to the now-open Discussions page on GitHub.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>2/28/2021:</dfn> Added enhancements suggested via the Hypixel Forums thread, tweaked those suggestions slightly, and did more styling changes. Not worthy of a version number as it does <em>not</em> majorly tweak or add a goal schema.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>3/1/2021:</dfn> Added a Code link to go to the GitHub repo itself, so you don't have to click Code from the Discussions link anymore.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>3/1/2021:</dfn> Changed the website colors to be websafe.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>3/1/2021:</dfn> Added an Updates details section and added some styling for the details element that is added. Not worthy of a version number as it does <em>not</em> majorly tweak or add a goal schema.</p></li>
            <li><p><dfn>3/1/2021:</dfn> Tweaked the Updates details section.</p></li>
            <!-- <li><p><dfn>3/1/2021:</dfn> Added a Jotter textarea that saves to your browser window's <code>localStorage</code> API once you press the "Jot!" button with script.</p></li> -->

          <p>When you first spawn on your island, you'll be on a plain island with grass, stone clusters, and a tall oak tree, without any chests and with nothing.</p>
          <p>Chop the tree's logs and leaves. Plant the saplings around the blocks spread around the island, then craft all the logs into planks.</p>
          <p>Craft a crafting table and then make a wooden pickax. Mine the stone that's above the grass, craft a stone pickax, and then mine the grass that's in a cluster above the rest of the ground.</p>
          <p>Use the dirt you've collected to bridge to the stone island in the distance. Mine the clay above the stone, then go down into the tunnel behind Jerry and loot the chest down there. Come back up, talk to Jerry, and then hop through the portal.</p>

          <p>It might sound boring and unnecessary, but after you get to the hub, you should talk to all the villagers to get information about the game and coins! The locations are:</p>
